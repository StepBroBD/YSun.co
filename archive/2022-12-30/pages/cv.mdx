## Research Experiences

### The University of Utah

- **Research Assistant**

- Salt Lake City, UT, USA

- 2021-08 to present

**Summary**:
Embedded system design, programming, data collection/analytics and distributed system automations in research of Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

**Details**:
Under advisor Prof. Dr. Shad Roundy's and co-advisor Prof. Dr. Tucker Hermans's supervision and in cooperation with Bateman Horne Center's clinical research team, developed our custom participant-facing and researcher-facing softwares, automation workflow and adapted previous analytical programs with innovative optimization for 20+ embedded devices and 100+ custom IMUs to collect large number of study participants' motion data (TB+) to analyze the relationship of processed sensor fusion data, study participants' daily activity and targeted medical syndromes.
We are planning to use our research outcome to propose to medical regulators as a possible standardized diagnostic procedure and severity categorization for Long COVID, ME/CFS and FM.
