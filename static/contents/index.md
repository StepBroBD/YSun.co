# Yifei Sun

I'm a masters student at Northeastern University studying computer science since September 2023.
Before joining NEU, I got my bachelors at University of Utah for my thesis
[System and Methods to Determine ME/CFS & Long COVID Disease Severity Using Wearable Sensor & Survey Data](/pdfs/bachelors-thesis.pdf)
under the guidance of [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and
[Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

My research interests are theoretical computer science and distributed systems:

- Type theory and type based program analysis for modern programming languages.
- Distributed systems and consistency model verification.

As a hobby project, I operate an autonomous system ([AS10779](https://as10779.net)) under [ARIN](https://www.arin.net).
I'm also an active OSS contributor, especially in the [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org) community on [GitHub](https://github.com/stepbrobd), where I'm a
[nixpkgs maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nixpkgs-maintainers) and
[darwin maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/darwin-maintainers).
