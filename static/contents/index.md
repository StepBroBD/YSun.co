# Yifei Sun

I'm a masters student at Northeastern University studying computer science since September 2023.
I have the fortune to be advised by Prof. [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).

Before joining Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I got my bachelors at University of Utah for my thesis
[System and Methods to Determine ME/CFS & Long COVID Disease Severity Using Wearable Sensor & Survey Data](/pdfs/bachelors-thesis.pdf)
under the guidance of Prof. [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and Prof.
[Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

My research interests include distributed systems and theoretical computer science ([see CV for more details](/cv.pdf)):

- Distributed systems related formal verification and program analysis
- High-performance managed runtime systems
- Type theory and type based program analysis for modern programming languages

As a hobby project, I operate [AS10779](https://as10779.net) under [ARIN](https://www.arin.net).
I'm also an active OSS contributor, especially in the [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org) community on [GitHub](https://github.com/stepbrobd), where I'm a
[nixpkgs maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/nixos/teams/nixpkgs-maintainers) and
[darwin maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/nixos/teams/darwin-maintainers).
