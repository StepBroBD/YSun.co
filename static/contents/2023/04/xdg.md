# XDG Base Directory Specification

The [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) is not some new thing, it's been around for a while.
Writing a new project? Use it. Updating an old project? Use it. It's not hard to implement, and it's not hard to use.

This is super easy to implement, you probably don't even need a library. But if you are lazy:
