I'm a MSCS student at Northeastern University.
I have the fortune to be advised by Prof. [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).

Before joining Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I got my bachelors at University of Utah for my thesis
[System and Methods to Determine ME/CFS & Long COVID Disease Severity Using Wearable Sensor & Survey Data](/pdfs/bt.pdf)
under the guidance of Prof. [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and co-advisor Prof.
[Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

I'm generally interested in systems and theory ([see CV for more details](/pdfs/cv.pdf)), topics include:

- Distributed systems related formal verifications and program analysis
- High-performance managed runtime systems
- Type theory and type based program analysis for modern programming languages
