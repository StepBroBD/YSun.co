I'm a MSCS student at Northeastern University.
I have the fortune to be advised by Prof. [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).
I visited [Computing Software Group](https://www.csg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) under Prof. [Tomoharu Ugawa](https://tugawa.github.io/index-e.html) at University of Tokyo during the summer of 2024.

Before joining Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I obtained my bachelors from University of Utah for my thesis
[System and Methods to Determine ME/CFS & Long COVID Disease Severity Using Wearable Sensor & Survey Data](assets/static/doc/bt.pdf)
under the guidance of Prof. [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and co-advisor Prof.
[Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

I'm generally interested in system and theory ([CV](/cv)), topics include:

- Formal verifications on distributed systems.
- Type theory and managed runtime systems.
- [Reproducible build systems](https://reproducible-builds.org).

I can't stand most Lisp dialects (especially Racket), but Emacs Lisp gets a free pass (cause it's actually useful).
I dislike Racket so much that I even made a [website](https://rkt.lol) and a [poster](https://rkt.lol/poster.pdf) about it.

To prevent spams, my contact info is hidden within the [source code of this website](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Astepbrobd%2Fysun+%22hidden%3A+true%22+%22external%3A+https%3A%2F%2F%22+%22layout%3A+redirect.vto%22&type=code).
After clicking the link, search for the platform you want to reach me on in all lowercase (e.g. [`github`](https://github.com/stepbrobd), [`linkedin`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yifei-s), etc.).
You can reach me directly with [Matrix](/matrix), Discord (use my GitHub username), or email (`echo -n 'eXN1bkBoZXkuY29tCg==' | base64 --decode`).

I ride a Trek Fuel EX 5 for fun and commute, and I daily-drive a Framework Laptop 13 with NixOS and a 14-inch MacBook Pro on the go.
I own and operate [AS10779](/10779) ([PeeringDB](/peeringdb)) with two IP assignments from ARIN.
I maintain 10+ packages on [`nixpkgs`](https://repology.org/maintainers/?search=ysun%40hey.com) and [actively](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=involves%3Astepbrobd) contribute to the Nix ecosystem.
During my free time, I enjoy swimming, [cycling](/strava), archery, and playing [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20905967) mania.
