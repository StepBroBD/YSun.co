I'm a MSCS student at Northeastern University.
I have the fortune to be advised by Prof. [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).
I'm currently visiting [Computing Software Group](https://www.csg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) under Prof. [Tomoharu Ugawa](https://tugawa.github.io/index-e.html).

Before joining Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I obtained my bachelors from University of Utah for my thesis
[System and Methods to Determine ME/CFS & Long COVID Disease Severity Using Wearable Sensor & Survey Data](https://static.ysun.co/pdfs/bt.pdf)
under the guidance of Prof. [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and co-advisor Prof.
[Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

I'm generally interested in systems and theory ([see CV for more details](/cv)), topics include:

- Distributed systems related formal verifications and program analysis
- High-performance managed runtime systems
- Type theory and type based program analysis for modern programming languages
