# HackMIT 2022

**TL;DR**

**Not quite finished yet, but I'm working on it.**

HackMIT 2022 is the first formal hackathon I've ever attended, the overall experience is not too bad.
But I can tell the organizers for this this year's event are not too experienced probably because it's the first in-person event since the COVID started.

And also, as of the time of writing this post (November 4, 2022), I still have not received the travel reimbursement they mentioned on their application portal (emailed them couple times but got no response).

## Prelude

I remember that was some day in late August, my friend [Luciano](https://www.lremes.com) called me on Discord telling to apply for HackMIT 2022.
The bois and I were constantly talking about hackathons and other coding related competitions (AoC, Kickstart, CodeJam, etc.),
so I jumped out of my cheap-ass IKEA mattress that's placed directly on floor and wrote a somewhat readable application.

Couple days (or weeks, can't remember) later, Jordan, [Luciano](https://www.lremes.com), [Mike](https://www.mikemarambio.com), and I got an email saying we were accepted, but the other bro of us, [Leo](https://zixuan-zhang.com),
got waitlisted (he didn't get accepted later on neither). Our bro, Jordan, went on a long trip to east coast right before the event, so he decided not to go to the event.
