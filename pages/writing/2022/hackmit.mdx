# 24 Hours of Innovation: Our Journey at HackMIT 2022

HackMIT 2022 is the first formal hackathon I've ever attended, and the overall experience is pretty amazing.
But I can tell the organizers for this this year's event are not too experienced probably because it's the first in-person event since the COVID started.

Late August. Lounging on my IKEA minimalist masterpiece, a Discord call with [Luciano](https://www.lremes.com) shattered the calm. HackMIT 2022, he said. Our fingers had been itching for a challenge, beyond the usual coding competitions. With a rush of adrenaline, I hopped to my desk and whipped up a half-decent application. The stage was set.

Fast forward a few weeks, the gods of HackMIT smiled on us, except for [Leo](https://zixuan-zhang.com) who got waitlisted. Not deterred, [Luciano](https://www.lremes.com), [Mike](https://www.mikemarambio.com), [Angela](https://apetrone.com) and I boarded our flight to Boston.

What followed was 24 hours of magic. Our team, replete with energy and ideas, set forth to build 'Sentik' - a tool to mine and analyze tweets for user-given inputs. Ticker symbols or keywords, you name it, Sentik can gauge it. With a snazzy Golang backend and Next.js frontend, our application aimed to offer real-time sentiments and insights, charted and tabled for easy consumption.

Sure, the event had its hiccups. Some teams seemed to have taken the sprint out of this hackathon, with suspiciously dated Github commits. We missed the memo on the time machine, it seems!

But let's not let a few speedsters overshadow an amazing 24 hours. Buzzing with enthusiasm, the halls of HackMIT 2022 were alive with fresh ideas, crisp code, and riveting innovation. And while we didn't clinch the top spot, the experience left us richer, filled with new ideas, cool swag, and fantastic memories.

HackMIT 2022 was an unforgettable roller-coaster ride. It was about thinking on our feet, solving problems in real-time, and above all, learning and having fun. Now, we're looking forward to more hackathons, more learning, and of course, more fun.
