# The Nix Way

This is a guide to my personal [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/stepbrobd/dotfiles) (mainly for macOS systems), use it as a reference to create your own.

What's Nix? It's a "functional" package manager.
With Nix Flakes, you provide a `flake.nix` file that describes your system, with input, couple "functions" that define your system, then it outputs a "derivation" that describes your system.
Like a function, if you give it the same input, you get the same output.

## Installation

I suggest anyone that wants to try out Nix not to use the official installer, but to use the [Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) by Determinate Systems.
It installs Nix, but also gives you an easy way to fully remove it.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

After this, if you are following online guides, they'll probably tell you to run some commands start with `nix-env` or `nix-channel`, don't use it!
As mentioned above, Nix Flakes is the new way to use Nix, it's more deterministic and reproducible, `nix-` commands are considered legacy and will be deprecated in the future.

Since we'll be using Nix Flakes, to prevent typing a lot of `--experimental-features` flags, we can set it in our `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` file.

```shell
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" > ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

To build the system configuration, we'll use the `nix build` command.

```shell
nix build github:stepbrobd/dotfiles#darwinConfigurations.$(nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command eval --impure --raw --expr "builtins.currentSystem") --show-trace
```
