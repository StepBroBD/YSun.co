# The Nix Way

What's Nix? It's a "functional" package manager.

With Nix Flakes, you provide a `flake.nix` file that describes your system, with input, couple "functions" that define your system, then it outputs a "derivation" that describes your system.

Like a function, if you give it the same input, you get the same output.

## Installation

I suggest anyone that wants to try out Nix not to use the official installer, but to use the [Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) by Determinate Systems.
It installs Nix, but also gives you an easy way to fully remove it.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
