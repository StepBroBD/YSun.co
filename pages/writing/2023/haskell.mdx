# Learning Haskell

My journey, running log, Haskell from zero to hero.

## First Line of Haskell in GHCi

In the official Haskell [Get Started](https://www.haskell.org/get-started) guide:

```hs
> take 10 (filter even [43..])
[44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62]
```

The `take` above, is a function call, `take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]`, meaning `take` get's a parameter
with `Int` type, a second parameter which is an array of any type (generic decleration, see more [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Generics)),
and returns an array of any type.

The evaluation result of `(filter even [43..])` is all numbers larger than 43 (inclusive) that's even.

```hs showLineNumbers filename="main.hs"
main = do
  putStrLn "Hello, everybody!"
  putStrLn ("Please look at my favorite odd numbers: " ++ show (filter odd [10..20]))
```
