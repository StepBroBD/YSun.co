## Employment

### University of Utah

- **Research Assistant**
- 2021/08 - 2023/05

Joint research project, PI: Suzanne Vernon, advisor: Shad Roundy, co-adviser: Tucker Hermans. In collaboration with the Bateman Horne Center's clinical research team, we developed and managed a new data collection infrastructure.

The infrastructure is built on 5000+ lines of Nix, Python, Go and C++, aggregating 100+ IMUs, 20+ single-board computers, and 3+ high-performance servers. We collected terabyte-level motion data, and applied sensor fusion, motion analysis, and machine learning techniques on collected time-series data and survey data. We are planning to use our research outcome to propose to medical regulators as possible standardized diagnostic procedures and severity categorization methods for ME/CFS, Long COVID, and other related medical syndromes.

### University of Utah

- **System Administrator**
- 2019/12 - 2020/09

Enterprise system administration, managed 1000+ university-owned Apple devices (Macs, iPads, Apple TVs, etc.).

Utilized Jamf Pro, Radmind, and Apple School Manager to perform day-to-day MDM tasks. Created multiple automation tools to perform unattended on-boarding, off-boarding, package licensing, updates, and distributions.

### DJI

- **Intern**
- 2018/07 - 2018/08

Competitive robotic system design/modeling, embedded system programming, control system programming, and computer vision. Developed path planning and task scheduling algorithms for predefined workflow.

Utilized STM32F4 platform to build out a robotic system with wireless image transmission, image recognition, automated reasoning, and task scheduling capabilities, following predefined rule sets to complete tasks.
